# Tournament Results

In this project, I have write a Python module that uses the PostgreSQL database to
keep track of players and matches in a game tournament.

The game tournament will use the Swiss system for pairing up players in each round:
players are not eliminated ,
each player should be paired with another player with the same number of wins,or as close as possible.

This project has two parts: defining the database schema (SQL table definitions), and writing the code using it.
